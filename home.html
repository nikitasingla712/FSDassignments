<h2><p>This weekend's special Hot Coffee</h2></p>
<h3><p>This weekend, our season of special hot coffee continues with cappuccino coffee. Light, foamy cappuccinos are a favorite drink for many a coffee lover. With two basic barista skills (pulling shots and foaming milk).
  </p></h3>
  <h3><p>A cappuccino is an Italian coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with double espresso, hot milk, and steamed milk foam on top. Cream may be used instead of milk and is often topped with cinnamon. It is typically smaller in volume than a caff√® latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.
