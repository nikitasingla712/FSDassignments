         <h1>Recipes - World's Best Cappuccino Coffee</h1>
         <p>A cappuccino is an Italian coffee drink that is traditionally prepared with double espresso, hot milk, and steamed milk foam on top. Cream may be used instead of milk and is often topped with cinnamon. It is typically smaller in volume than a caff√® latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.</p>
         <p>Microfoam is frothed/steamed milk in which the bubbles are so small and numerous that they are unseen, but make the milk lighter and thicker. When the espresso if poured correctly, the microfoam will remain partly on top of the mug as well as mix well with the rest of the cappuccino.</p>
         <p>Cappuccinos are usually made using an espresso machine. The double espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk, which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine steam wand. The top third of the drink consists of milk foam; this foam can be decorated with latte art made with the same milk.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
           <li>2 shots espresso (a double shot)</li>
           <li>4 ounces milk</li>
           </ul>
           <h2>Instructions</h2>
           <ol>
             <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
             <li>Pull a double shot of espresso into a cappuccino cup.</li>
             <li>Foam the milk to double its original volume.</li>
             <li>Top the espresso with foamed milk right after foaming. When initially poured, cappuccinos are only espresso and foam, but the liquid milk quickly settles out of the foam to create the (roughly) equal parts foam, steamed milk, and espresso for which cappuccino is known.</li>
             <li>Serve immediately.</li>
             </ol>
